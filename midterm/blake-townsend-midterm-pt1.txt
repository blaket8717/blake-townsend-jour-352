Questions

users to click on the word UMD and open UMD's homepage in a new

2. In which main "area" or "section" of an HTML page would you put meta
tags, a webpage title and a stylesheet link?

*Answer*:
Inside the "<head>" section

3. Write out the basic structure of an HTML page, putting the basic tags
in the correct position.  (Note: you don't need to connect it to a
stylesheet or include DIV tags or anything like that).

    <title>Blake Townsend</title>

  <body>

      <p>Hello World! <p>

  </body>

</html>

4. There are two main "areas" or "sections" in the basic structure of an
HTML page. In which area would you put a Bootstrap "row"?

*Answer*: In the "<head>" section.

5. Explain the purpose of using DIV tags.

*Answer*: I like to think of a DIV tag as a container (something we use in class a lot). All of the content within this tag will be kept inside of a box, and this way we can separate our content on our webpage from other DIVs. Also allows you to style a certain section of the webpage.


6. In the space below, put one DIV tag with an id of content_row and a
second DIV tag with a class of headline.

*Answer*:
<div id="content_row"> </div>
<div class="headline"> </div>

7. In the space below, put one DIV tag with a class of peaches and an ID
of spaghetti.

*Answer*:
<div class="peaches" id="spaghetti"> </div>

8. In the space below write the correct CSS code to target a <p> tag.
Make the size 5em and the background orange (#FFA500).

*Answer*:
p {
font-size: 5em;
background-color: #FFA500
}

9. What HTML tag does this class use to make text bold? Just give me the
name of the tag, you don't have to write out all the code.

*Answer*: There's two. The "<strong>" or "<b>" tags.

10. What is the purpose of using a media query?

*Answer*: Basically the whole purpose of media query is to adjust styling for different devices/views. Say we are looking at an HTML page at 600px wide, then the HTML structure will adjust for that display and will return to normal when it's at its default setting.

11. What is the main difference between a serif and a sans-serif font?

*Answer*: Serif has the cute little tails at the end of their letters to style it up a little, where as Sans-serif is much more boring and nothing to really style up the letters.

12. Which of the following is a hexadecimal code?
#FFCC33
123,543,242
101010101
- 213

*Answer*: #FFCC33
